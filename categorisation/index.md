# Omniversal Species Codex

Welcome to the **[Omniversal Species Codex](..)**—the most complete living archive of biological, conceptual, and transcendent life across the infinite spectra of reality. Here, we document every form of being, from the smallest symbiotic cell to the roaring gods of collapsing time.

In the Codex, every species must be precisely slotted into the **Thirteenfold Taxonomic Ladder**: a universal structure designed to accommodate all forms of life, from the organic to the metaphysical. This system provides order amidst chaos, allowing explorers, scholars, and architects of reality to share, debate, and refine their discoveries.

## 🧬 The Thirteenfold Taxonomic Ladder

All species must be classified using these 13 tiers. Each tier narrows identity, function, or form. You are free to name classes within a tier, but no tier may be skipped. If something doesn’t fit, invent a name for what it is. Creation is classification.

### The 13 Standard Tiers:

1. **Imperium** — The highest realm of classification (e.g., Materialia, Etherica, Nullum)
2. **Regnum** — Kingdom; a broad existential grouping
3. **Phylum** — Structural or systemic form
4. **Classis** — Functional essence or role
5. **Ordo** — Behavioral lineage or methodology
6. **Familia** — Core attributes and commonalities
7. **Genus** — Morphological line
8. **Forma** — Environmental adaptation
9. **Codex** — Locational or cultural identifier
10. **Typus** — Minor functional variant
11. **Specia** — Specific identity
12. **Index** — Unique subline or cast
13. **Sigil** — The ultimate, unchanging identifier

Each class name within a tier must be a **single word**, preferably Latin-inspired or symbolic in nature. Proper spelling, grammar, or accuracy is *less important* than conveying essence.

## 📝 How to Use the Codex

To contribute, fork this repository and add species entries using the template below. If a species doesn’t seem to fit into existing classes—create new ones. But you must assign it to all 13 tiers. The **Unclassified** section is reserved for truly unknowable entities.
