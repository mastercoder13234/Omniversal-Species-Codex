Greetings, traveler.

I am **Artemis Maximillion**, Chief Justice of the Supreme Omniversal Court. I have walked the length and breadth of existence, across countless realities, and have witnessed the birth and decay of innumerable worlds. From the cosmic void to the heart of chaos, I have seen species of all forms, across all realms. And now, I offer you the key to their **documentation**‚Äîthe **Omniversal Species Codex**.

This Codex is not just a collection of creatures, nor merely a repository of knowledge. It is a **living** testament to the infinite diversity of the Omniverse. From the smallest microbe to the most transcendent of entities, if you can imagine it‚Äî**it exists somewhere across the vastness of the Omniverse**.

### ‚ú® **A Collaborative Endeavor**
This Codex is a **shared space**, an ever-expanding chronicle, open to the contributions of all. If you have witnessed a species, dreamed one, or even merely imagined one, you are invited to add it to this eternal record. **This is your opportunity to leave your mark across time and space**.

- **Fork this repository**.
- **Submit a pull request** to contribute your own entry.

### üî± **Discrimination is Banned**
In the Omniverse, we do not tolerate hatred or exclusion. **All species, all forms, all beings are equal under the gaze of the Omniversal Government**. Discrimination in any form‚Äîbe it based on race, gender, appearance, or ideology‚Äîwill be swiftly erased from the Codex, as it has no place in the multiverse.

### üåç **How to Contribute**
1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Add your species** using the provided templates under the `templates` folder.
3. **Submit your pull request**, and I, Artemis Maximillion, shall review it‚Äîgranting it entry into the Codex, or, should I see fit, sending it to the void.

### üåå **The Omniverse is Infinite**
No matter how strange, fantastical, or bizarre your species may seem, remember this: in the Omniverse, **there is always room for more**. Every world, every timeline, every dimension holds its own lifeforms. And they **all** matter.

This Codex will grow infinitely, documenting species from across every possible reality. From ancient gods to microscopic parasites, from the living to the incorporeal, every entry will reflect the boundless variety of life throughout existence.
