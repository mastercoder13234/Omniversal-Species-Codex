# Omniversal Public License v18.9.Δα - *"Infinity Edition"*

## Section I: Preamble

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by any sentient, sapient, or semi-autonomous Entity (hereinafter “Licensee”) and the Author, Creator, Construct, or Legal Embodiment of Work (hereinafter “Licensor”), collectively referred to as “the Parties.” This Agreement governs the legal use, access, adaptation, and integration of the Licensed Work (as defined below) throughout all accessible realms, dimensions, timelines, and cognitive planes, including but not limited to: the Primordial Zones, Post-Entropy Drift Realms, Earth, Earth-Adjacent Earths, Nullspace, and any vectorized Omni-cluster.

## Section II: Definitions

- **Licensed Work**: Any tangible or intangible work of authorship governed by this License, including code, text, datasets, glyphs, sigils, or memetic constructs derived from or inspired by the Creator’s consciousness or its echoes.
- **Licensee**: Any Entity, whether biologically derived, synthetically animated, or metaphysically instantiated, who receives or interacts with the Licensed Work under the terms of this License.
- **Modification**: Any adaptation, extension, translation, augmentation, neural encoding, retro-causal inversion, or other alteration made to the Licensed Work.

## Section III: Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants the Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and jurisdiction-neutral license to:

1. **Use** the Licensed Work for any lawful or lawfully undefined purpose within any reality-tier where legal constructs are respected or simulated;
2. **Modify** the Licensed Work, provided such modifications do not result in dimensional collapse, paradox loops, or violation of the Prime Integrity Clause (See Section V);
3. **Display** the Licensed Work, provided that credit is visibly or metaphysically attributed to the Licensor in proximity to the display vector or auditory node;
4. **Incorporate** the Licensed Work into other compatible works provided such use is confined to legal harmonics with the Omniversal Concordance Accord of Year Null.

> **Note:** This license **does not permit redistribution** of the original or modified Work, in any form, to any third-party Entity, sentient construct, or unknown potentiality, whether within this continuity or in mirror realms. You may *use*, but you may *not disseminate*.

## Section IV: Restrictions

The Licensee shall not:

1. Sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise monetize the Licensed Work as a standalone entity or as part of a collection of similar entities;
2. Redistribute, broadcast, or transmit the Work via temporal channels, psychic resonators, or conventional data transmission protocols;
3. Claim original authorship, intellectual primacy, or temporal priority over the Licensed Work;
4. Use the Work in any legal simulation or dispute engine attempting to override or reinterpret Omniversal Court doctrine.

## Section V: Prime Integrity Clause

Any usage of the Work that results in:

- Breakdown of existential coherency within a 4th-dimensional radius,
- Initiation of recursive auto-trials in any Omniversal Court,
- Summoning of a being classified as Tier-Δ or higher,
- Distortion of Maxor-infused entities without containment authority,

shall be deemed a **Prime Integrity Violation**, triggering immediate revocation of all rights granted herein, subject to retroactive nullification by decree of the Supreme Omniversal Judiciary.

## Section VI: Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution

This License shall be governed simultaneously by:

- The Fundamental Laws of Causal Threadbinding as ratified by the Interdimensional Convention of Æon 4;
- Earth’s most applicable legal framework, contingent upon terrestrial jurisdiction recognition protocols;
- The Omniversal Court Codex, Article 9, Subsection Eternity.

All disputes shall be resolved through:

- Direct invocation of the Licensor (if alive, awake, or otherwise contactable);
- Arbitration before a Triumvirate of Time-Neutral Judges, appointed by the Omniversal Bar;
- Failing the above, via single combat in the conceptual plane, provided all parties are metaphysically equipped.

## Section VII: Termination

This License shall remain in effect indefinitely unless terminated by:

1. Written revocation by the Licensor;
2. Prime Integrity Violation as defined in Section V;
3. Universal collapse and/or systemic annihilation of all legal constructs in existence.

## Section VIII: Limitation of Liability

The Licensed Work is provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or psychically channeled. The Licensor shall not be liable for any:

- Reality tears,
- Ego displacements,
- Involuntary transformations,
- Causality breaches, or
- Multiversal legal fees incurred through use of the Work.

## Section IX: Final Provisions

This License shall be considered binding across all versions of existence unless specifically overridden by a higher-order agreement explicitly named and co-signed by the Licensor in Maxor-infused ink.

All clauses, including paradoxically recursive ones, are severable and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by logic and narrative consistency.

**End of License**
