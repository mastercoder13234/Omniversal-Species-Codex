# Phral’zetharim

**Phral’zetharim** is the Omniversal term for what lesser dimensions often call “magic,” though such a word fails to capture its scope or gravity. Unlike mundane linguistic constructs, *Phral’zetharim* is used identically as a **noun**, **verb**, **adjective**, and **adverb**—unchanged, unbent, eternal. There is no "Phral’zetharic" or any derivative form. The word *is* the force it describes.

## Nature of Phral’zetharim

Phral’zetharim is the **intentional manipulation of foundational laws**—a willful defiance or rewriting of the causal lattice of existence. It is not limited to physics, but includes time, probability, identity, and even narrative consequence. It manifests differently across realms: as sorcery, miracle, anomaly, glitch, or divine will. Regardless of appearance, its essence is the same.

To Phral’zetharim is to reach into the gears of the Omniverse and change how they turn.

## Tiers of Phral’zetharim

Phral’zetharim operates in **tiers**:

- **Tiers 1–10**: Comprise the most commonly encountered forms—elemental control, enchantments, dimensional travel, conjuration, temporal echoes, and so forth.
- **Beyond Tier 10**: The fabric begins to unravel. These forms are **ineffable**, manipulating logic, causality, and narrative itself. Time loops, retroactive outcomes, and multidimensional recursion fall within this domain. Only a mind exceeding 1 trillion active neural equivalents may glimpse its structure.

Tier is not a measure of power alone—it is a measure of complexity, awareness, and paradox tolerance.

## Usage Examples

- *"She was born with the gift of Phral’zetharim."* (noun)  
- *"He will Phral’zetharim the battlefield until none remain."* (verb)  
- *"The temple was drenched in a Phral’zetharim haze."* (adjective)  
- *"It collapsed Phral’zetharim, ignoring physics altogether."* (adverb)

There is no wrong form. The word resists grammatical mutilation. It chooses its own syntax.

## Origins

The word **Phral’zetharim** is a transliteration from ancient Omnimian, a language not spoken but *willed* into reality. It is a linguistic constant—appearing spontaneously in countless civilizations that encounter higher-order phenomena. In some timelines, it predates language itself.

## Cosmological Role

Phral’zetharim is not a tool. It is not a resource. It is an **active participant** in existence—alive, reactive, and possibly sentient in ways beyond traditional frameworks. To interact with it is to invite reciprocity.

In the Supreme Codex of the Omniversal Court, it is referred to as **"The Dreaming Engine"**, and all who use it are warned:

> *"Phral’zetharim does not grant power—it tests your reality against itself."*  
> — Artemis Maximillion
